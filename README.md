COVID-19 Spread Simulation 2020: Simulates COVID-19 dynamics using the SIR model, with stochastic elements and Monte Carlo comparisons. Analyzes interventions' effectiveness and predicts epidemic trends.

---

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to simulate the spread of COVID-19 throughout the year 2020, using the SIR model to track the transition of populations through susceptible, infected, and recovered stages. The results are then compared to real-world data to evaluate the model's accuracy and potential improvements.

## Features

- **SIR Model Implementation**: Utilizes the classic epidemiological SIR model to simulate the spread of COVID-19.
- **Stochastic Modifications**: Enhances the basic SIR model with stochastic elements to introduce variability and realism into the simulation.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Applies Monte Carlo methods to estimate parameters and assess the uncertainty of the simulation results.
- **Data Comparison**: Compares simulated data against actual COVID-19 case data to validate the model's effectiveness.

## Objectives

- To understand the dynamics of COVID-19 spread using a compartmental model.
- To assess the impact of various parameters like transmission rates and recovery rates on the disease spread.
- To evaluate public health interventions and their effectiveness in controlling the epidemic.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For implementing the simulation and data analysis.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Used for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **SciPy**: For integrating differential equations in the SIR model.
- **Plotly**: For visualizing the simulation results over time.

## Repository Contents

- **Scripts**: Contains Python scripts for running the SIR model and Monte Carlo simulations.
- **Data**: Includes real-world COVID-19 data for comparison.
- **Results**: Visualization outputs showing the progression of the disease over time.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the methodology, model assumptions, and findings.
